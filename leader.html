                        professional effectiveness. is a concept from Stephen Covey's "7 Habits of Highly Effective
                        People" that describes a person's growth journey. It includes three stages that is, dependence,
                        independence and interdependence. In dependence, we rely on others to meet our needs("Attitude
                        of You") and as we mature, we move towards independence("Attitude of I") This where we become
                        self-sufficient and taking responsibility for our actions. Finally, interdependence is the most
                        mature stage, where we collaborate with others to achieve goals that are greater than what we
                        could accomplish alone. It's about valuing both our own strengths and the strengths of others,
                        creating a win-win situation. </p>

                    <p class="card-text mb-auto">Stephen Covey's "7 Habits of Highly Effective People" explores the
                        concept of paradigms which are frameworks that shape how we see the world and
                        interact with others.
                        Dr. Covey outlines five main paradigms:
                        Win-Lose: This is where someone must lose for another to win. This can lead to conflict and
                        hinders cooperation, ultimately limiting
                        success.
                        Lose-Win: This paradigm emphasizes sacrificing one's own needs to please others, often leading
                        to resentment and a lack of personal fulfillment.
                        Win-Win: This collaborative approach seeks mutually beneficial solutions, prioritizing
                        communication, respect and cooperation. This fosters stronger relationships and sustainable
                        success for all parties involved.
                        Lose-Lose: This paradigm is characterized by a lack of effort and negativity, resulting in
                        failure for everyone involved.
                        Win: While focusing on personal goals and achieving individual fulfillment is
                        important, this paradigm can neglect collaboration and building positive relationships.</p>

            <h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom ">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</h1>
            <h3>Habit 1: Be Proactive</h3>
            <p>This habit is all about making decisions and taking responsibility for my life.</p>
            <p>It emphasizes taking control of your life by recognizing that you have the power to choose your responses
                to
                any situation. Rather than being reactive to external circumstances, proactive individuals focus on what
                they can influence and take responsibility for their actions, attitudes, and outcomes.</p>
            <p>The principles of effectiveness are responsibility, choice, initiative, accountability. There are four
                unique human gifts and these are, self-awareness, imagination, conscience, independent will.</p>

            <h3>Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind</h3>
            <p>This is the habit of personal vision(1st Creation).</p>
            <p>This habit emphasizes defining your values and goals before taking action. By envisioning their desired
                destination and defining their personal mission, individuals can align their actions with their
                long-term objectives, leading to greater purpose, focus, and effectiveness.</p>
            <p>This emphasizes on having a personal mission for you life. This is because a mission provides direct and
                purpose, represents the best for you and addresses the most important aspects in your life</p>
            <p>The principles for this habit are vision, commitment and purpose</p>

            <h3>Habit 3: Put first things first</h3>
            <p>This is a habit of personal management</p>
            <p>Effective individuals prioritize activities that align with their values and goals, focusing on important
                but not necessarily urgent tasks over less critical ones. By managing their time and energy effectively,
                they achieve a balance between short-term demands and long-term priorities.</p>
            <p>The principles for effectiveness are focus, discipline, integrity and prioritization</p>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Time matrix</h4>
            <img src="./images/q1.png" alt="" class="center">

            <p>In the above time matrix, we have to minimize Q1 and Q3 and maximize Q2. We have to spend more time
                in Q2 because Q4 is the quadrant os waste.</p>

            <h3>Habit 4: Think win win</h3>
            <p>This is the habit of mutual benefit</p>
            <p class="mb-5">This habit emphasizes collaboration and seeking mutually beneficial solutions. It encourages
                looking beyond competition and finding solutions where everyone thrives. By focusing on win-win
                scenarios, you foster trust and build stronger, more sustainable relationships.

            </p>

            <h3>Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood</h3>
            <p>The principles of effectiveness for this habit are, respect, empathy, courage and mutual understand</p>
            <p class="mb-5">
                Effective communication is key to this habit. It emphasizes truly listening to understand another
                person's perspective before trying to share your own. This builds trust and meaningful connections.
                It has different examples of autobiographical responses that is, probe, evaluate, advise and
                interrupting.
            </p>


            <h3>Habit 6: Synergize</h3>
            <p>This is the habit of renewal.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">
                This habit focuses on the power of teamwork and collaboration. It recognizes that the whole can be
                greater than the sum of its parts. By valuing different perspectives and working together creatively,
                individuals can achieve more than they could alone.
            </p>


            <h3>Habit 7: Sharpen the saw</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">
                This final habit emphasizes self-renewal. It reminds us that continuous improvement in all aspects -
                physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual - is vital for long-term effectiveness. By investing in
                yourself, you ensure you have the energy and capacity to maintain and build upon your achievements.
